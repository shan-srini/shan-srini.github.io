                        Since High School, I have been quite involved with this organization. Ekal helps provide education
                        to rural parts of India, where it is not easily accessible. I am very familiar with the administration
                        of the Boston chapter, and have always been available to lend a helping hand at events, in addition to
                        starting a few of my own.

                        <p style={{ width: "80%", margin: "auto auto" }}>- Organized and ran three “Appathon” events, each which individually raised over $1000, in which students were taught to build mobile events
                <br />- Continually provided assistance to this non-profit by raising money at numerous events and assisting in conducting various tasks to ensure smooth and enjoyable fundraiser events
                </p>
                        <br />
                        EKAL Appathon's are a creation of the High School version of two friends and I, who set out to create
                        an event where we could educate the rural populations of India, by helping educate the not so rural populations
                        near us. By charging a fee to attend a Hackathon type event in which we taught students how to use a web
                        application called Thunkable, in order to easily create mobile applications, we raised a sizable amount
                        for a charity which we valued.
                    <br />
                        Using a guideline which we created, EKAL Appathons were also run a few times across the nation in different
                        chapters of EKAL.
